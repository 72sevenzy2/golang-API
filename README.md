# Practice golang API
(modularized version of HTTP-service)
This is a greet handler API which takes in a user through the request body and responds with a greet message with the user.

# features:
- i used my own http router for this project (http-router) to handle the greet endpoint
- includes json helpers to parse request body (which should be in json format), and to send json responses.
- includes a health endpoint to check if the API is running.
